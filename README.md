# context-minimals
A reproducible ConTeXt LMTX distribution. Sources checked and updated weekly.

## Run me with Nix!
These are some common ad-hoc usages.
```sh
# run context by default; or luametatex, luatex, mtxrun by specifying them
nix run github:usertam/context-minimals
nix run github:usertam/context-minimals#mtxrun

# get a shell with all the goodies
nix shell github:usertam/context-minimals
```

## Setup with binary cache
Now comes with binary cache at [context-minimals.cachix.org][6]! However, only `x86_64-linux` and `x86_64-darwin` are cached as of now, because GitHub Actions.
```sh
# add to $HOME/nix/nix.conf (user) or /etc/nix/nix.conf (system)
extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes
extra-substituters = https://context-minimals.cachix.org
extra-trusted-public-keys = context-minimals.cachix.org-1:pYxyH24J/A04fznRlYbTTjWrn9EsfUQvccGMjfXMdj0=
```

## Tex PDFs declaratively, with flakes
In `flake.nix`, use [`mkCompilation`][7] in `modules/lib/default.nix` to compile `main.tex`.
```nix
{
  inputs.context-minimals.url = "github:usertam/context-minimals";
  inputs.photo.url = "https://unsplash.com/photos/.../download";  # include extra files, but only in `nix build`
  inputs.photo.flake = false;

  outputs = { self, context-minimals, ... }@inputs: let
    fonts = [ "source-han-serif" ]; # include nixpkgs-provided fonts
    fcache = [ "sourcehanserif" ];  # force build font caches, useful for slow CJK fonts
  in {
    packages = context-minimals.lib.mkCompilation {
      inherit fonts fcache;
      src = self;
      nativeBuildInputs = [ "imagemagick" ];  # include tools to use in `postUnpack`
      postUnpack = "convert -quality 100% -despeckle ${inputs.photo} $sourceRoot/photo.jpeg";
    };
    apps = context-minimals.lib.mkCompilationApps {
      inherit fonts fcache;
    };
  };
}
```

## Remarks
By default, installing ConTeXt LMTX requires downloading a prebuilt [`mtxrun`][1] to bootstrap the installation. The installation script `mtx-install.lua` is then run, downloading and extracting archives in the process; after which the modules would need to be installed [separately][2]. While the defaults focus on the ease of maintaince (running `mtx-update`), the internals are harder to dissect.

The installation script is a lengthy [lua script][1], making the fetching and extracting steps unclear from first glance. The [two-part installation][2], platform-dependent [setups][3] and [install steps][4] also didn't make it easy to follow. Along with the use of unpinned prebuilt [binaries][5], it was challenging to reproduce an installation that could be used out-of-the-box.

#### Solution
The project didn't follow the installation script, but rather reconstructs the tex structure based on the sources and by looking at the artifact. The reworked steps are then trimmed down and implemented in `default.nix`, building binaries `luametatex` and `luatex` from source. Fonts and font caches are another can of worms, and needed a number of patches to stay deterministic but functional.

Apart from the reproducibility of the ConTeXt installation, the deterministic compilation of PDFs is another goal of the project. ConTeXt does offer flags like `randomseed`, `nodates` and `trailerid` to disable non-deterministic PDF subtleties, but not well-documented. Therefore, functions like `lib.mkCompilation` are provided to offer "standard" ways to compile PDFs.

Note that non-determinism can still be introduced by macros like `\date`. For MetaPost, `randomseed := 0;` is still needed to make `uniformdeviate` deterministic.
